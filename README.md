# README

This repository contains a collection of example scripts on how to use ARTS with Python. They are ment as a starting point for your own scripts. For simple use of ARTS with Python, we make use of the FluxSimulator package that facilitates and speeds up the more complicated processes like generating your own lookup tables. 

The FluxSimulator is available on GitHub and can be installed either by cloning the repository or by using pip. You can clone the FluxSimulator repository by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/atmtools/pyarts-fluxes/tree/main
``` 
Alternatively, you can install the FluxSimulator package using pip by running the following command in your terminal:
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/atmtools/pyarts-fluxes/tree/main
```
